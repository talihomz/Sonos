# Frontend Starter

This project allows you to speed up frontend development by providing tools and a basic structure, letting you focus on building the page and getting immediate feedback on how it looks.

PS: Don't forget to personalize this README to fit your specific project details.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 


### Prerequisites

Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) in your machine.

After installation, run `node -v` and confirm that your output has Node >8.
```
$ node -v
v9.8.0
```

### Installing

Run `npm install` to install all project dependencies.

### Start Frontend development

Run the server with the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

Once its running, head over to your browser to [see your page/frontend app](http://localhost:3000/).

From here on, all changes you make on your code will be visible on your page without the need of a full page reload.
The project builds SCSS files and optimizes images on the go as well.

We plan on adding JS builds as well in the near future.

### Additional commands

Build CSS with the following command: 
```
npm run build:css
```

Optimize images in public folder with the following command: 
```
npm run build:images
```

### Deploy

The project builds all of your site files into the *public* folder. Copy this folder to your web server inorder to see it live on your own deployment.
